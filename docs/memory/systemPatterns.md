# System Patterns

Operational map of stable system behavior. Keep this file short; put deep analysis in technical docs.

## Core patterns

- **App orchestrator**: `packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx` coordinates lifecycle, scene/app-state integration, action application, rendering, and API exposure.
- **Action pipeline**: actions produce `ActionResult`; `App` applies scene/app-state/file changes and forwards capture intent to `Store`.
- **Store + History contract**: `Store` emits increments; `History` records durable ones for undo/redo; commit keeps store view aligned with scene/app-state.
- **Two state layers**: React `AppState` tracks UI/editor flags; scene structures remain the authoritative element graph.

## Snapshot behavior (operational summary)

- `CaptureUpdateAction` is a 3-mode contract, not a boolean flag.
- Preserve current semantics:
  - `IMMEDIATELY` => durable increment + snapshot advance
  - `NEVER` => ephemeral increment + snapshot advance
  - `EVENTUALLY` => ephemeral increment + snapshot hold
- Preserve precedence: `IMMEDIATELY > NEVER > EVENTUALLY`.
- Preserve micro-vs-macro distinction (`updateScene()` micro scheduling vs macro scheduling).
- Preserve retained deleted elements in snapshot where history/diff fallback depends on baseline retention.

### Safe refactor boundary

- **Safe**: extract helpers, improve naming/comments, add focused tests, clarify docs.
- **Unsafe without intentional redesign**: changing snapshot-advance rules, action precedence, stale-baseline dedupe policy, or micro-vs-macro comparison semantics.

## Timing-sensitive behavior

- Clipboard paste handling has same-tick/same-frame constraints in browser event flow.
- Treat timing assumptions as behavioral contracts during refactors.
